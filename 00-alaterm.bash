# Part of the alaterm project, https://github.com/Zenmyjf/alaterm/
# This file is: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zenmyjf/alaterm/master/00-alaterm.bash
declare versionID=1.0.4 # Enhanced March 11, 2020.
# Usage within Termux home on selected Android devices:
# bash alaterm.bash action
#   where action is one of: install remove help
#   abbreviated as: i r h
# Interactive script. Requires meaningful user response from time to time.
# You cannot just launch it and walk away while it works.
#
# Copyright and License at bottom of this file.
#
# * This BASH script installs portions of Arch Linux ARM into the Termux app,
#   for Android-based devices that have an ARM processor.
#   This includes many tablets and Chromebooks, but not all of them.
# * You do not need root access. This script does not enable root access.
# * Installation works with small screens and touchscreen-only devices,
#   but the benefits are best realized when the screen is 10.1 inches or more,
#   and you have a keyboard and mouse.
# * The installation is optimized for ordinary users, rather than programmers.
#   It assumes that you intend to run programs such as GIMP image editor,
#   but you do not intend to setup a file server or upload packages.
# * This is not a dual-boot. Android runs alongside alaterm at all times.
#   For example, Android can play Bluetooth music and connect to the Internet,
#   even while you are using a program such as GIMP in alaterm.
# * If your intended usage is programmer-friendly file server things,
#   then the Termux Arch project by SDRausty is better suited to your needs.
# * This script is compatible only with devices that have an ARM processor,
#   and use the armeabi-v7a or arm64-v8a Android software suite.
#   You do not need to know that info, since it is measured by the script.
#   But if your device does not run Android, or uses an Intel or AMD CPU,
#   then the script will reject your device.

##############################################################################
# THESE ARE THE ONLY USER-CUSTOMIZABLE SETTINGS:
# You can install via this script and SDRausty script independently,
# as long as alatermTop and launchCommand are different. OK by default.
# 1. Where alaterm will be installed. Default: installDirectory=alaterm
declare installDirectory=alaterm
#    * In Android, Termux is at /data/data/com.termux directory.
#    * That contains several directories. Among them:
#      /data/data/com.termux/files/usr is where Termux keeps its own programs.
#      /data/data/com.termux/files/home is home, where Termux starts.
#    * If you install to the recommended default location, then
#      /data/data/com.termux/alaterm will be the alaterm / root directory.
#      That root directory will contain alaterm /bin, /etc, /home, and so forth.
#    * The alternative, by SDRausty, installs to Termux home/arch.
#    * Advantage of installing to the default location is that
#      alaterm will not be accidentally removed, if you clean Termux home.
# 2. To launch alaterm from Termux. Default: launchCommand=alaterm
declare launchCommand=alaterm
#    * The alternative script, by SDRausty, uses: startarch
# END OF USER-CUSTOMIZABLE SETTINGS.
##############################################################################
# MAINTAINER NOTE:
# This script recognizes only the armeabi-v7a and arm64-v8a ABI.
# This includes all ARM ABI used as of early 2020, including some Chromebooks.
# No newer ABI have been announced, although this is possible in the future.
# If a newer ABI is released, AND the Arch Linux ARM project has an archive
# compiled for that ABI, then you can attempt to use this script.
# In that case, you will need to edit references to CPUABI, the Arch archive,
# and its md5 checksum. This must be done in all the component scripts.
##############################################################################


# The various portions are broken into several files, processed in order.
# They are NOT stand-alone. They must be processed using this file as master.
# The developer has a trick for debugging the individual files,
# but you, the user, cannot do it that way.

# When each component finishes, it writes info to a status file that is retained.
# In case of problem, it is possible to examine the status file,
# which will show the last component that completed successfully.
# The status file also holds some variables that are read during install.
# If your installation is interrupted, it will resume from where it left off,
# thanks to data automatically read from the status file.

# This script expects an Android file structure, with Termux installed
# in the expected directory. Check this now, and exit if bad.
# Explanation: $termuxTop should be Android /data/data/com.termux, or similar.

## If necessary, download the component scripts to the current directory:
export mainurl="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zenmyjf/alaterm/master"
cd "$hereiam"
echo -e "\e[1;92mDownloading scripts from the alaterm repository at GitHub...\e[0m"
for nn in 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08
do
	if [ ! -r "$nn-alaterm.bash" ] ;then
		wget "$mainurl/$nn-alaterm.bash" >/dev/null 2>&1
	fi
done
if [ ! -r fixexst-scripts.bash ] ; then
	wget "$mainurl/fixexst-scripts.bash" >/dev/null 2>&1
fi

## Verify that the component scripts are here:
allhere="yes"
cd "$hereiam"
for nn in 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08
do
	if [ ! -r "$nn-alaterm.bash" ] ;then
		allhere="no"
	fi
done
if [ ! -r fixexst-scripts.bash ] ; then
	allhere="no"
fi
if [ "$allhere" = "no" ] ; then
	echo -e "$PROBLEM One or more of the component scripts failed to download."
	echo "Wait awhile, then re-launch this script. Exit."
	exit 1
else
	echo -e "\e[92mGot the scripts. Continuing...\e[0m"
	echo "Android may ask if you wish to stop optimizing battery usage."
	echo "You may allow or deny, but installation is faster if you allow."
fi

## Process the component scripts:
start_termuxWakeLock # Needed from this point. Released by any exit or error.
for nn in 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08
do
	cd "$hereiam"
	source "$nn-alaterm.bash"
done
# fixexst-scripts.bash is sourced in 08-alaterm.bash.

exit 0 # So that the following License is not precessed as script.
